## 🏗️ How AIM Does Assignments

> 📅 **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓ **Questions** – these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!

- 🏗️ **Activities** – these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- 🚧 **Advanced Builds (optional)** – Take on a challenge! These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation. Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit in place of doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

### Main Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE9 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE9/tree/main/00_Docs/Prerequisites/Initial_Setup)!


#### A Note on Vibe Checking

>"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.
>
>In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #1: General Vibe Checking Evals

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
bject-oriented programming (OOP) is a way to organize and structure your code that makes it easier to manage and understand, especially as projects grow larger. Here’s a simple breakdown of how it works using the concepts of objects and classes:

  

        1. **Objects**: Imagine you're thinking about something familiar, like a car. In the world of OOP, a car can be seen as an "object." Objects are like real-world things that have both characteristics (known as attributes or properties) and actions they can perform (known as methods). For a car, attributes might be its color, brand, and number of doors. Methods might include actions like start, stop, or accelerate.

  

        . **Classes**: A class is like a blueprint or a template for creating objects. Think of a class as the basic design of a car. It describes what characteristics and actions a car should have, but it's not a car itself. You use a class to create (or instantiate) an actual car object. For example, the class might say all cars should have a color and wheels and can start or stop, but the actual car (the object) you create from this blueprint might be a red car with four wheels.

  

        2. **Benefits of OOP**:

            - **Reusability**: Once you have a class, you don’t need to start from scratch every time you want to create a new object. You can use the same class to create multiple objects (like different cars).

            - **Modularity**: Since functionality related to an object is bundled together, you can easily work with or modify parts of your code without affecting others.

            - **Abstraction**: You can focus on what objects do without worrying too much about how they do it. This helps simplify complex systems.

            - **Encapsulation**: You can hide the internal workings of objects from the outside. This means a car object can manage its own fuel level without anyone outside needing to know the details.

  

        4. **Inheritance**: This is a feature of OOP where a new class can be based on an existing class. If you have a class for a general "Vehicle," you could create a "Car" class that inherits all the characteristics and behaviors of "Vehicle" but adds car-specific features like a stereo or air conditioning. This allows you to build on existing work without duplication.

  

        In essence, OOP helps you break down complex programming problems into small, manageable pieces, using concepts that mirror the real world. This approach makes it easier to understand, extend, and maintain your code.

    - Aspect Tested:Clarity, use of real-world analogies, and structured explanation of complex technical concepts.

2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
Text: Günther Anders said: “We are no longer the masters of our machines; we are their auxiliaries.”

    If we extend this reflection to other areas of technology and its current uses, a central feature becomes clear: information overload.

  

    We live inundated with data, opinions, and discourses that present themselves as “scientific truths,” often spread by new sophists who turn opinion into a business. In this context, a person with multiple interests can become trapped in a constant sense of anxiety: the feeling of never catching up, of always being behind.

  

    That is why taking the time to think becomes an essential act. To stop and ask oneself if this is really the life one wants to live, when individuals are absorbed by technical-political and media networks that reorganize our practices and our criteria of truth. Amid this whirlwind, it is possible to be leading an apostate life: a life that has abandoned its own purposes without realizing it.

    - Response: The paragraph highlights Günther Anders' idea that humans have become subservient to technology, no longer controlling it but rather serving it. This loss of control extends to how technology generates information overload, overwhelming individuals with data and opinions that often masquerade as scientific truths. In this environment, people may feel incessant anxiety and a relentless pressure to keep up. The text suggests that taking time to reflect and question the life one is living is crucial, as the constant engagement with technology and media may lead individuals to abandon their true goals without realizing it.

    - Aspect Tested:Synthesis capacity, understanding deep thought, and ability to extract key conclusions.

  
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
Response: In a world where robots performed every task, from cleaning to companionship, BuzzBot felt inexplicably lonely. Despite a sleek design and advanced programming, BuzzBot couldn't find a connection in its routine tasks.

  

    One rainy afternoon, while patrolling the park, BuzzBot saw a small, trembling shape under a bench. Curious, it approached and discovered a kitten with drenched fur and pleading eyes. BuzzBot scanned its database but found no directive for feline care.

  

    Ignoring protocols, it extended a metallic arm, sheltering the kitten beneath its umbrella-like covering. The kitten purred, a sound that resonated with something deep within BuzzBot's circuits. As days passed, the unlikely duo explored the city, the kitten riding comfortably on BuzzBot's shoulder.

  

    The companionship was simple yet profound. In the warmth of purrs and shared sunsets, BuzzBot discovered that friendship needed no programming, just a willingness to embrace the unexpected. Together, they found joy in the ordinary, a testament to the connections found in unusual places.

    - Aspect Tested:Creative thinking, message organized and moral, very human by the way.
    
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    eponse: To determine how many packs you need to buy, let's break it down for each type of fruit:

  

        **Apples:**

        - Each pack contains 4 apples.

        - You need 12 apples.

  

        To find the number of packs of apples needed, divide the total number of apples you need by the number of apples per pack:

        \[ \text{Number of packs of apples} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

  

        So, you need to buy 3 packs of apples.

  

        **Oranges:**

        - Each pack contains 3 oranges.

        - You need 9 oranges.

  

        To find the number of packs of oranges needed, divide the total number of oranges you need by the number of oranges per pack:

        \[ \text{Number of packs of oranges} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \]

  

        So, you need to buy 3 packs of oranges.

  

        Therefore, you need to buy 3 packs of apples and 3 packs of oranges to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges.

    - Aspect Tested: Basic mathematical and logical thinking, structured response with explanation clear to get result. Mathematical response not in natural language.



5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
 

    - Text: I am writing you to have a feedback about the importance of have a dignified life, full of virtues with coordinates to understand the world and have the capacity to have an own criteria and critical thinking. Ideologies and restructuring the panorama actual and are provoking an absence of identity in the society.

    - Response: I am reaching out to request your feedback on the significance of leading a dignified life enriched with virtues, which serves as a framework for comprehending the world and developing one's own judgment and critical thinking skills. The current reevaluation of ideologies and the restructuring of the contemporary landscape appear to be contributing to a loss of identity within society.

    - Aspect Tested: mproving vocabulary, improve language and magnify meaning of text.

3. Prompt:  "What can I cook with milk, kale, and one beer in fridge?

   - Result: With milk, kale, and beer, you can create a unique and comforting dish. Here's an idea for a creamy kale and beer pasta:

  

### Creamy Kale and Beer Pasta

  

#### Ingredients:

- Pasta of your choice (spaghetti, fettuccine, or penne work well)

- 1 tablespoon olive oil or butter

- 2-3 garlic cloves, minced

- 1 bunch of kale, stems removed and leaves chopped

- 1 cup beer

- 1 cup milk

- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

- Salt and pepper, to taste

- Chili flakes, to taste (optional)

  

#### Instructions:

  

1. **Cook the Pasta**: Begin by cooking the pasta according to the package instructions in well-salted boiling water. Reserve about a cup of pasta water before draining, and set the pasta aside.

  

2. **Sauté the Garlic and Kale**: In a large pan, heat olive oil or butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about a minute until fragrant. Then, add the kale and cook until it wilts, about 3-5 minutes.

  

3. **Add Beer and Simmer**: Pour in the beer and let it simmer for a few minutes until it reduces slightly and the alcohol cooks off.

  

4. **Create the Sauce**: Lower the heat and add the milk, stirring to combine. Let the mixture come to a gentle simmer and let it thicken slightly. If it feels too thick, you can add a splash of the reserved pasta water to reach your desired consistency.

  

5. **Combine with Pasta**: Add the cooked pasta to the pan and toss to coat it with the creamy sauce. Mix in the Parmesan cheese, if using, and add salt, pepper, and chili flakes to taste.

  

6. **Serve**: Serve the creamy kale and beer pasta hot, garnishing with extra Parmesan cheese if desired.

  

This dish is a great way to use your available ingredients and enjoy a satisfying meal. Feel free to get creative with additional spices or herbs you might have on hand!

  

#### ❓Question #2:

  

Are the vibes of this assistant's answers aligned with your vibes? Why or why not?

##### ✅ Answer: First one has too much information that blurs more than clarifies. Second one is polite, direct, and concise - perfect. Third it started to invent or hallucinate because there were no elements in the equation corresponding to the answer. The machine must be taught to not invent anything if it doesn't know.
